# personal-assistant-using-python
Its very simple method to create your personal assistant using python


pip install the libraries i used. i have attached two different files. checkout for indentation errors and correct it. you can add multiple features like speech recognition by importing proper pip file.

personal assistant 2 is very simple with only typing feature whereas the other can recognise your voice.


PS: my clint name of wolfframe alpha won't work by the time you are reading this. create one for yourself.
